🔄 When Does Steam Cloud Sync Happen?
✅ 1. On Game Launch
When you start a game through Steam, the client first checks if there's newer cloud data available.

If a newer version is found in the cloud, it downloads the relevant files to your local system before the game starts.

✅ 2. On Game Exit
When you close the game, Steam checks which files (from the configured sync paths) have changed.

If any files have been updated, it uploads those to the Steam Cloud.

⚠️ 3. On Steam Shutdown
If you quit the Steam client itself, it may perform a final sync of any pending cloud changes.
